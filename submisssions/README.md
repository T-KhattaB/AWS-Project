# Model Submissions

This directory contains CSV files with prediction results from our trained models, formatted for Kaggle competition submissions.

## Purpose

The `submissions` folder stores the output prediction files generated after testing our machine learning models. These CSV files are specifically formatted to meet Kaggle submission requirements.

## Contents

- CSV files containing model predictions
- Each file represents a different model run or version
- Files follow Kaggle's required format for the specific competition

## Usage

After training and testing a model:

1. Generate prediction results in CSV format
2. Save the file to this directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `model_v1_predictions_15-2-2025.csv`)
3. Upload the CSV file directly to the Kaggle competition submission page

## File Format

Ensure that all CSV files conform to the specific format required by the Kaggle competition, typically with appropriate headers and correct data types.
